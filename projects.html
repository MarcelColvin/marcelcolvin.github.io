        <h3>Geo-Spatial Classification Project</h3>
        <p>
          For my capstone data science project at UC Davis, my team and I worked on a Geo-Spatial
          Classification project. The goal of this project was to accurately
          classify what crop was growing in a field based on light bands from
          satellite images. We used python to apply machine learning methods such as kNN and
          Extra Trees to light distributions in each field at 2 different growing
          seasons in order to create an algorithm that was able to classify at 90%
          accuracy. <a href = "https://marcelcolvin.github.io/Crop_website/">[READ MORE]</a>

        <h3>Salary Cap Project</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to analyze the difference between sports leagues
          that utilize a salary cap for fairness versus leagues that do not implement
          salary caps. This project was also an investigation into how Leicester City,
          a team that has never been in competition for the English Premier League title
          was able to win in the 2015-16 season. This project uses linear regression and
          kNN to show that in the Premier League era, dominated by money from oil giants and
          foreign oligarchs, it really was a miracle that Leicester City was able to win.
